Dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tunguz/ibrd-statement-of-loans-historical-data

*Objective:*
The project aimed to explore and analyze World Bank Loan Data, leveraging Python for data preprocessing and SQL for in-depth queries. The comprehensive workflow involved data loading, cleaning, exploration, and visualization using tools like Pandas and Tableau.

*Key Steps:*

1. **Data Loading:**
   - Loaded World Bank Loan Data into a Pandas DataFrame from a CSV file.
   - Explored columns and data structure for initial insights.

2. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Identified and handled duplicate rows using Pandas.
   - Addressed missing data by removing null values in specific columns.
   - Removed unnecessary columns for better focus on relevant features.
   - Converted data types and standardized date formats.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Calculated the number of loans taken by each country.
   - Explored regions with the highest loan amounts and identified patterns.
   - Investigated credit status, project details, and repayment metrics.

4. **SQL Queries:**
   - Utilized SQL to perform advanced queries on the dataset.
   - Extracted insights such as total loan amounts per project, top countries by loan ratio, and the number of fully repaid projects in each region.

5. **Tableau Visualization:**
   - Created Tableau dashboards for intuitive data representation.
   - Visualized top countries by loan amount, repayment ratios, and regional loan patterns.
